=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # In a test script like 't/test-fixme.t'
 use Test::Fixme;
 run_tests();
 
 # You can also tailor the behaviour.
 use Test::Fixme;
 run_tests( where    => 'lib',      # where to find files to check
            match    => 'TODO',     # what to check for
            skip_all => $ENV{SKIP}  # should all tests be skipped
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When coding it is common to come up against problems that need to be
addressed but that are not a big deal at the moment. What generally
happens is that the coder adds comments like:

 # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
 
 # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.

L<Test::Fixme> allows you to add a test file that ensures that none of
these get forgotten in the module.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run_tests

By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
find in the project. You can change these defaults by using 'where' or
'match' as follows:

 run_tests( where => 'lib', # just check the modules.
            match => 'TODO' # look for things that are not done yet.
 );

=over 4

=item where

Specifies where to search for files.  This can be a scalar containing a
single directory name, or it can be a list reference containing multiple
directory names.

=item match

Expression to search for within the files.  This may be a simple
string, or a qr//-quoted regular expression.  For example:

 match => qr/[T]ODO|[F]IXME|[B]UG/,

=item filename_match

Expression to filter file names.  This should be a qr//-quoted regular
expression.  For example:

 match => qr/\.(:pm|pl)$/,

would only match .pm and .pl files under your specified directory.

=item manifest

Specifies the name of your MANIFEST file which will be used as the list
of files to test instead of I<where> or I<filename_match>.

 manifest => 'MANIFEST',

=item warn

Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
have been failures will still issue a diagnostic that will be viewed
when you run C<prove> without C<-v>, C<make test> or C<./Build test>.

=item format

Specifies format to be used for display of pattern matches.

=over 4

=item original

The original and currently default format looks something like this:

 # File: './lib/Test/Fixme.pm'
 #     16      # ABSTRACT: Check code for FIXMEs.
 #     25          $args{match} = 'FIXME' unless defined $args{match} && length $args{match};
 #     28          $args{format} ||= $ENV{TEST_FIXME_FORMAT};
 #     228      # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
 #     230      # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
 #     239     By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
 #     280     Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
 #     288     If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
 #     296      run_tests( skip_all => $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );
 #     303     L<Devel::FIXME>

With the line numbers on the left and the offending text on the right.

=item perl

The "perl" format is that used by Perl itself to report warnings and errors.

 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 16:
 #  # ABSTRACT: Check code for FIXMEs.
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 25:
 #      $args{match} = 'FIXME' unless defined $args{match} && length $args{match};
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 28:
 #      $args{format} ||= $ENV{TEST_FIXME_FORMAT};
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 228:
 #   # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 230:
 #   # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 239:
 #  By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 280:
 #  Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 288:
 #  If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 296:
 #   run_tests( skip_all => $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );
 # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 303:
 #  L<Devel::FIXME>

For files that contain many offending patterns it may be a bit harder to read for
humans, but easier to parse for IDEs.

=back

You may also use the C<TEST_FIXME_FORMAT> environment variable to override either
the default or the value specified in the test file.

=back

=head1 HINTS

If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
that the test file itself is being caught. Try doing this:

 run_tests( match => 'TO'.'DO' );

You may also wish to suppress the tests - try this:

 use Test::Fixme;
 run_tests( skip_all => $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );

You can only run run_tests once per file. Please use several test
files if you want to run several different tests.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1.  It may work on 5.8.0.
It should work on Perl 5.6.x and I may even test on 5.6.2.  I will accept
patches to maintain compatibility for such older Perls, but you may
need to fix it on 5.6.x / 5.8.0 and send me a patch.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Dave O'Neill added support for 'filename_match' and also being able to pass a
list of several directories in the 'where' argument. Many thanks.
